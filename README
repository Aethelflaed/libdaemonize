libdeamonizer
=============

A lightweight library to easily create daemon in C++.

You deamon should simply inherit `daemon_t` and put it's starting point in the `run` method. You can get the log object from your daemon, and anything you write to it will be send to syslog.

An example main could look like:

```c++
int main(int argc, const char** argv)
{
  try
	{
		my_daemon d;
		daemonizer daemon("my_daemon", &d);
	}
	catch(int status)
	{
		return status;
	}
	catch(...)
	{
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	}

	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
